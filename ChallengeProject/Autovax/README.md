Welcome to the autovax-docs wiki!

# OVERVIEW:
* Autovax is a WEB APPLICATION that allows a vaccine and other treatment drugs to be automatically generated from the virus genome and virus genes
* i.e. accept a virus genome file/link + gene specification --> generate a vaccine and/or drug treatments automatically
* i.e. Make a web page that accepts a virus genome with identified genes and creates gene suppressor proteins
* ... I would like the program to create trello cards for each recommended drug so it can be tested 
* ... but I would also like it to automate testing with a wet lab protocol for advanced machines to test each drug for effectiveness
* It is being developed by Harvard Researcher for treatment of corona virus.
